Description:

This plugin shows the status of VDR via commands:
when VDR starts, cmd_on is send;
when VDR stops, cmd_off is send;
if VDR is recording, cmd_on/off is send (as often as recordings are active).

Requirements:
=============

- vdr 1.2.x (1.1.x should be work also)
- for prewarn beeps beep needs to be installed and the kernel might need CONFIG_INPUT_PCSPKR


Installation and Compilation:
=============================

- cd $VDR/PLUGINS/src
- Extract statusleds-*.tgz
- ln -s statusleds-* statusleds
- cd $VDR
- make plugins


Running the plugin:
===================

- Append -Pstatusleds to the vdr commandline 
- Append plugin parameters, if you don't want to use the OSD

  -n cmd_on, --cmd_on=cmd_on

  -f cmd_off, --cmd_off=cmd_off

  -d timing, --duration=timing    Sets the timing values in 100ms
                                  Format: on-time,off-time,on-pause-time
				  Default: 1,10,5

  -p, --perrecordblinking         Enables record count signalisation


How active recordings will be signaled:
=======================================

- If recordings are active, the commands are send:
  - Blinking per record is disabled:
    - The cmd_on is send for on-time
    - The cmd_off is send for off-time
  - Blinking per record is enabled:
    - The cmd_on is send for on-time and cmd_off is send for on-pause-time. This repeats
      for each concurrent recording.
    - The cmd_off is send for off-time
- If no recording is active, the selected led is turned on

OSD:
====

- The plugin is configurable via the OSD
- There is an entry Settings->Plugins->statusleds

PROBLEMS:
=========

- The command line switch -d seems not to be functional.
- If vdr was killed with signal -9 during active recording the LED may remain on.
